== To Do ==

- Is there a way to automatically add one particular particle system (with special settings) to each person without manually copy/pasting the component into the prefab inspector for each person?

- Require the player to pick up a bow before being able to shoot
- Visually add a bow to the player
- Allow player to drop bow
- Add charge attack to bow, including visual indicators (ping noise, particles)

- Make enemies killable

- Create a dungeon with multiple rooms that are unlocked when the previous rooms are defeated (need to expand upon the random room generator)


== Ideas ==

- Player should have 1 primary weapon/armor that he improves throughout the game
